## 📚 Standards & Subjects

This interactive aligns with the following topics and standards:

- **📂 Subject Area**: High School Math (Algebra I)  
- **🧮 Topic**: Simplifying Square Roots Using Prime Factorization  
- **📏 Common Core**:  
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.8.EE.A.2** – Use square roots and cube roots to solve real-world and mathematical problems.  
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.8.EE.A.3** – Use numbers expressed in the form of a single digit times an integer power of 10 to estimate very large or very small quantities, and to express how many times as much one is than the other.  
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.8.EE.A.4** – Perform operations with numbers expressed in scientific notation, including problems where both decimal and scientific notation are used.  
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.8.EE.B.5** – Graph proportional relationships, interpreting the unit rate as the slope of the graph. Compare two different proportional relationships represented in different ways.  
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.8.EE.B.6** – Use similar triangles to explain the constant of proportionality (unit rate) in the context of scaling.
